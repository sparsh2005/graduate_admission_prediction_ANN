# graduate_admission_prediction_ANN
The "Graduate Admission Prediction using ANN" project aims to predict a student's likelihood of admission into a graduate program based on their academic and personal profile. 

Problem Definition: The project seeks to build a model that predicts the chance of admission (as a probability) to a graduate program using various features from the applicant's profile.

Note: The aim while creating this project was NOT to create an extremely accurate predictor, but to learn how to implement Artificial Neural Networks in a 'Regression' based problem
